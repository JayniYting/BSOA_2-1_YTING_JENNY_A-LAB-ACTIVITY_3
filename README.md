# LAB ACTIVITY 3

## CREATING A MOCK UP HOMEPAGE

### QUESTIONS:

1. What color choices did you make and why?
2. How did you apply accesibility fizes?
3. What challenges did you face?

### ANSWERS:
1. The colors that I've choose is Dark Blue, Blue, and White. Because I want to establish the professionalism of the website and also showing minimalism.
2. I keep in mind the consistency of font size and spacing for readability. Icons are also included to make the website a little bit creative to make it engaging.
3. The challenge that I've faced while editing the website is customizing the theme. I'm not familiar of some setting in the theme since I use Plover settings but I quickly learned it and eventually got used to it.
